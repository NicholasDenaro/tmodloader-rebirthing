Add a leveling, rebirth, and transcendence system to Terraria.
Rebirth to increase your stats and become super strong.

You can level up through the following activities:
- Killing enemies
- Mining valuable blocks
- Fishing
- Crafting

The amount of exp per level is calculated by: 20 + (int)Math.Pow(5, 1 + (level - 1.0) / 10)

The Rebirther

The Rebirther is immediately unlocked and available to move in.
Talk to the Rebirther to rebirth and reset your levels and gain Rebirth Energy. You will gain 1 Rebirth Energy per level.
Spend Rebirth Energy to increase your stats, like Health, Health Regen, Speed, Damage, Critical Chance, etc.

The Transcender

The Transcender is unlocked once a player reacher total level 50 or has already transcended.
Talk to the Transcender to transcend, consuming your rebirth energy to gain Transcendence Energy.
Transcendence Energy can be used similar to Rebirth Energy but provides extra stats on top of rebirth stats.
Transcendence stats are usually multiplicative on top of Rebirth stats, so they can provide extra boost.

The Terra Lord

The Terra Lord is unlocked once the Moon Lord has been defeated at least one time.
Talk to the Terra Lord to reset the vanilla boss process and increase the game difficulty.

Difficulty progresses as following:
Normal -> Expert
Expert -> Master
Master -> Master+
Master+ -> Master++ (etc)

Each level of Master+ multiplies the stats of enemies by 2.
This means that Master++ will give x4 stats, and Master+++ will give x8 stats.
